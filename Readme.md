## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Arduino IDE

- üì• Download: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software  
- üì¶ Add ESP32 Board URL:  
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json`  
  - Go to File > Preferences > Paste URL into "Additional Board URLs"
  - Then Tools > Board > Board Manager > Search and install **ESP32**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Libraries

Install these via **Library Manager** (Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries):

- [`PZEM004Tv30`](https://github.com/olehs/PZEM004T-v30)
- [`Adafruit_SSD1306`](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306)
- [`Adafruit_GFX`](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library)
- [`PubSubClient`](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Your Code

Edit these lines:

```cpp
const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";
const char* access_token = "YOUR_THINGSBOARD_ACCESS_TOKEN";
````

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Upload & Monitor

* Select Board: **ESP32 Dev Module**
* Connect USB and select the correct COM port
* Click **Upload**
* Open **Serial Monitor** at **115200 baud**

---

## üì° Telemetry Format (MQTT)

Published to: `v1/devices/me/telemetry`

```json
{
  "voltage": 229.1,
  "current": 1.55,
  "power": 355.0,
  "energy": 8.42
}
```

---

## üñ• OLED Display Output

```
Smart EV Monitor
V: 229.1 V
I: 1.55 A
P: 355.0 W
```

---

## üßæ Serial Energy Receipt

Printed every 5 readings (\~25 seconds):

```
=== Energy Receipt ===
Total Energy: 8.42 Wh
Duration: 0.2361 h
Avg Power: 35.67 W
=====================
```

---

## üß† Notes

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Energy value is **calculated manually** as `Power √ó Time` to support simulation tools like **Wokwi**
* Make sure you **create a device on ThingsBoard** and use the matching access token
* Real PZEM sensors will give `.energy()` values directly
